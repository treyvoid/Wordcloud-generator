# Wordcloud-generator
A word cloud is a popular visualization of words typically associated with Internet keywords and text data. They are most commonly used to highlight popular or trending terms based on frequency of use and prominence. A word cloud is a beautiful, informative image that communicates much in a single glance.

A. For Jupyter Notebook users-
    1. Make sure to start it in a new notebook.
    2. Try to keep the text file to be uploaded in the same directory as the code.(This will make it easier for you to browse the file)
    
B. For Linux users-
    1. Don't forget to install all the modules before running the .py code.
       
       Run following commands on your terminalbefore running the final code:-
        1) pip install wordcloud
        2) pip install fileupload
        3) pip install ipywidgets
        
       Note :- Remember to check your python version before installing fileupload module.
       It is necessary for fileupload to be run alongside the required python version.
       
    2. Keep your fle to be uploaded ready. And make sure its a TEXT file(.txt).
    
END NOTE:
   
   Any changes to the repo is most welcome as the file uploader widget can behave differently with different versions of OS and python. Feel free to make changes and collaborations. Thank you.
